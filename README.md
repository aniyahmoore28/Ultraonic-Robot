# Project description
Me and my team mate Hope made an automatic plant watering system. The plant holder would be placed on top of a spinnable disk. The coding would act as oinstructions telling it when and when not to water. We used Onshape and google docs to our advantage along with audrino for the code. The building part was fairly easy being that we have practice in that area. Working with Audrino was a little dificult since i did not get the chance to learn a lot of codeing last year due to COVID-19. Putting all of that aside i had a really great time learning and struggling aong the way. I aquiried the knowledge to write out a simple suto code and a little bit of the basic code. This project really helped expand my horizon on the things i needed to work on. Im proud of our project and i cant wait to learn more and more as the year goes on.
