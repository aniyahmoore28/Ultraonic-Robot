# Project description
Me and my team mate Hope made an automatic plant watering system. The plant holder would be placed on top of a spinnable disk. The coding would act as oinstructions telling it when and when not to water. We used Onshape and google docs to our advantage along with audrino for the code. The building part was fairly easy being that we have practice in that area. Working with Audrino was a little dificult since i did not get the chance to learn a lot of codeing last year due to COVID-19. Putting all of that aside i had a really great time learning and struggling aong the way. I aquiried the knowledge to write out a simple suto code and a little bit of the basic code. This project really helped expand my horizon on the things i needed to work on. Im proud of our project and i cant wait to learn more and more as the year goes on. 

# Scheduale
Wednesday, January 27th: Research coding/ start CAD design 
Wednesday, February 3rd: Make the ultrasonic sensor button (run through code also)
Wednesday, February 10th: Complete the last parts 
Wednesday, February 17th: Assemble
Wednesday, February 24th: Test for any kinks

# Suto Code 
When switch is flipped powers on (no code really needed)
When something is 10 millimeters away from sensor it will

	Dispense water
	Rotate disc once

When switch is flipped power gets cut

# Paper Sketch
This was our first paper sketch, it helped up create the concept we were going for

# Plant Holder Measurments
The plant holder was extruded to make a height of 170.
The base of the plant holder are 110mm
Drafted at 8 degrees
A shell was then placed on the outer edge for a cleaner look

# Base Measurments
The base was extruded 5mm
The diameter of the base oval Is 144.802mm
